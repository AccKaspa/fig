# Pear Example

### Why Fruit is So Nutritious 

Please watch [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2G97xz78gU&list=PLEZwCXa1K8Q629mWmpcSYCVMDoi0s8hzI&pp=iAQB) to see the founders demonstrate their remarkable work
 
The code used here can be found documented [here](https://docs.pears.com/guides/making-a-pear-desktop-app)

Pear, originally called HolePunch, is a suite of open source tools built upon the [bare javascript runtime](https://docs.pears.com/bare-reference/overview). In their overview of bare, the Pear Team say:

> Bare is a small and modular JavaScript runtime for desktop and mobile. Like Node.js, it provides an asynchronous, event-driven architecture for writing applications in the lingua franca of modern software. Unlike Node.js, it makes embedding and cross-device support core use cases, aiming to run well on any system whether that is a phone or desktop. The result is a runtime ideal for networked, peer-to-peer applications that can run on a wide selection of hardware

This is javascript built with to be as bare and lightweight as possible. It is performant and can find itself on most devices you would care to find software on. Yet to truly live out this vision, we must test, build, and then imagine. This demo code is what the founders of pear have left us with to begin spreading our fig upon. We will find our fig spread from Pear to Pear.

Pear allows for testing, sharing, and shipping applications in every phase of their creation from the smallest scraps of processing to the most baroque endeavours. Though you read this on GitHub, we ship fig through pear and we simply stage the bare minimum you need to start spreading fig all throughout the pear toolchain. Pear can even be invoked from C. 

We Snails wish to integrate fig and pear with iron on rust. The inspired founders of Pear cherish Bitcoin, and should we not pay homage to the greats which have forged the world in which we find our lives played out? However, we snails want to go fast, simply put. Iron on Rust will iteratively like Newton's method spread rusty-kaspa Pear to Pear enabling rapid confirmation of hyperbolic silver at your fingertips. 

We start with snailmail which is a faithful fork of the pear you find in this directory. If I imagine what fig on pear will taste like, I come to see Holders of the KRC-20 token $FAST gaining the ability to sign their messages with their same private key that shows they are who they are on the Iron on Rust kaspa network. We snails will bring our slime to complex networks beyond the block while sublimating their structural principles towards new heights of sacchrine effervescence. May we transcend our old networks on the very same hardware that we could hitherto not imagine working otherwise.
